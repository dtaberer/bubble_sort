# bubble_sort

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]


rspec -f d spec/

#bubble_sort

  should return [1, 2, 3, 4] when we call the bubble_sort method with [3, 4, 2, 1]

  should return [1, 2, 3, 4] when we call the bubble_sort method with [3, 10, 10, 12, 3, 4, 1, 5]

  should return ['at', 'bat', 'cat', 'pat', 'pull', 'push', 'sat'] when we call the bubble_sort method 
with ['at', 'bat', 'cat', 'pat', 'pull', 'push']
